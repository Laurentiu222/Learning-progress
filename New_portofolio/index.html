        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Developing small projects like portfolios. The first iteration of this project is an interesting one
              using a small javascript script a navigation bar and hoovers that display links to a few different
              projects. Aesthetically is pleasing but the simplistic form lead me to do a second version of that
              project.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Another project would be a small guessing number game. It takes a user input of a number between 0 and 9
              and evaluates that guess with a random number(0-9), as well as the guess made by the computer to find the
              winner.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Throughout my GitHub you will be able to find different projects and exercises from a beginner lever to a
              level of more advanced implementation, alghtou I am still not that experienced I try to create as many
              projects as I can to clarify the basics and new abilities.</p>
