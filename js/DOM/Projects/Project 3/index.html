      <div class="question">For how long did you work in Front-End?</div>
      <div class="answer">For about a year now, but due to University work, it was not the most stable learning process.</div>
      <div class="question">Why did you choose Front-End?</div>
      <div class="answer">I chose this field because it's creative and fun. It allows the creator to bring to life ideas that can create communities and help people to evolve. It also has a different approach to programming than other specialties my computer engineering soon to have diploma.</div>
      <div class="question">What abilities do you have?</div>
      <div class="answer">I started by polishing my CSS skills so that I can create the 'clothes' of the websites I create, and not just blank pages with some HTML elements present on them. After that I started to give mobility to the pages I created by implementing JavaScript to them, also I learned some useful PHP form applications and submissions like the implementation of CRUD.</div>
